    <string name="tutorial_text_1">\n\n\nWelcome to Coinz \n\n\n The goal of Coinz is to get as much <b>GOLD</b> as
        possible.\nCoinz are positioned all around George Square, in order to collect them you have
        to walk to its location in the real world! Walking near a coin will activate your coin
        magnet that scoops up any coins within 25m of you. You can see the location of coinz on the
        map screen. New coinz are added each day and the previous day's removed so be quick!

    <string name="tutorial_button_1">
        Got it!
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_text_2">
        The coinz you collect are stored in your wallet. There are 4 different types of coin you
        will pick up: PENY, QUID, DOLR and SHIL. Once coins are in your wallet, you can trade them
        with other players or exchange them with the bank.\n\n\nBy submitting coinz to the bank you get
        GOLD in return, GOLD represents you score and cannot be deposited or traded. The value of
        each coin in GOLD change as players deposit into the bank meaning that if everyone puts in
        one type of coin, it\'s value will fall meaning you get less GOLD for the same amount of
        coinz! It\'s up to you to figure out when the best time to deposit is.
